Run the Flask Backend:

Start the Flask backend by running the command:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Ensure that the Flask app is running and listening on port 5000 (or any port you choose).
Open the HTML Form:

Open the HTML file in a browser.
Enter some data (e.g., name and email) and click Submit.
The data will be sent to the Flask backend, which will save it to your RDS MySQL database.
Check the Database:

After submitting the form, you should see the new record inserted into your MySQL table on RDS.
4. Security and Considerations:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains or ports, you might need to enable CORS in your Flask app. You can use the Flask-CORS extension:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask-cors
And then add this to your Flask app:

python
Copy code
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
Database Credentials: Never hardcode sensitive data like your RDS password directly in the code. Use environment variables or configuration files to store credentials securely.

Validation: Ensure that the data sent by the user is properly validated and sanitized to avoid SQL injection and other security risks.

Summary:
Frontend (HTML): A simple HTML form that collects data from the user and sends it to the Flask backend.
Backend (Flask): A Flask app that handles the POST request, saves the data to the RDS MySQL database, and returns a success message.
RDS (MySQL): The data is inserted into your MySQL database hosted on RDS.
This setup allows you to collect data from a user and save it to your RDS MySQL database using Python (Flask) and HTML.
